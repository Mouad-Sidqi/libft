# libft

Recreation of libc functions. EDIT: includes GNL and some improvements.

Description of the project :

The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during Day-06 of the bootcamp
i.e code a library of useful functions that you will be allowed to reuse in most of your C
projects this year.

Only the following libc functions are allowed : malloc(3), free(3) and write(2),
and their usage is restricted.
